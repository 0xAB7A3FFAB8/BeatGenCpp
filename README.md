# BeatGenCpp

BeatGenCpp is a cpp lib that generates the json code for a Beat Saber .dat file.
This is in early developement so bugs might occur.

Currently generation is only mostly implemented for the v 2.x format (including sliders [But There Kinda Buggy] ) but v 3.x support is planned.


## Plans for the Future

###### Defenetly:

  -Noodle Support

  -v3.x support
  
###### Maybe:

  -1.x support
  
  -Mapping Extensions Support
